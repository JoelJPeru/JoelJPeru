			<h1 class="column">Origin of LAG</h1>
			<h3>LAG started as a group of friends and streamers wanting somewhere to meet up, stream together, and just hang out. Captain Z had the Idea of creating a Discord where everyone could do just that! The Discord started out as a server called "AX|Z" with a few channels where the streamers started bringing in their friends to game with. As more and more people started to join the AX|Z server, the name didn't make sense anymore. After some brainstorming, the name "The Legendary Ass Gamers" was decided to be the new name with the three letter "LAG" as the abreviation.<br /><br />
			The name didn't seem to fit well, were we horrible at gaming? "Allied" replaced "Ass" a few days later. We are all friends here, why not be allies in gaming?<br /><br />
			<strong><i>Legendary Allied Gamers was born.</i></strong></h3>

			<h1 class="column">LAG Goals</h1>
			<h3>LAG Gaming (Legendary Allied Gamers Gaming) wants everyone in the community to find their place. LAG Gaming is all of LAG and more! From those who just want to hang out to the hard core gamer/streamer, LAG is meant to be for you. If you want to relax and watch some people play games while talking with other members, you can do that here. <br /><br />
			The long term goal of LAG Gaming is to build a community where fans can go watch their favorite teams play together, and by favorite teams we mean LAG Gaming! Our goal is to enter teams into tournaments around the world for various types of games. We want gamers and members to be able to root on the players playing in the tournaments.<br /><br />
			We want everyone to feel welcome here at LAG!</h3> 
		</div>
		<div class="flexboxSmall">
			<h1 class="column">Community Centered</h1>
			<h3>The LAG Community is a big focus of LAG. Without the community there is not LAG Gaming, we want everyone to have a place here. If you need help with a level, LAG is meant to be the place you can ask for help no matter what! If someone in a multiplayer game is giving you a hard time, LAG is there to help! <br /><br />
			LAG Members can enjoy a sense of companionship with the other members of the community. The goal for the LAG Community is to be able to drop into any game you want with any of your friends or members from the community!<br /><br />
			Welcome to the LAG Community, we hope you enjoy being with us! We are always welcoming new members willing to make this the best commmunity ever!</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="flexboxSmall">
			<h1 class="column">Streamer Friendly</h1>
			<h3>LAG Gaming is a streamer friendly heaven, we want streamers to be able to let their followers know they are live and be able to connect rapidly with them! If you aren't a streamer, no sweat! Grab some friends and go help a fellow LAG Member out and enjoy a stream or two with them! Unlike many communities, we will not give an incentive or level up for watching other streamers. We want you to find streamers you like and enjoy them. That doesn't mean we wont encourage self promotion though, we want streamers to be able to grow quickly, but not a fake growth, and build a loyal viewer base!<br /><br />
			We will always encourage community and streamers to connect! Streaming is a huge part of the gaming community and we want to grow with you!</h3>
